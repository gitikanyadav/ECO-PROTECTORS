# ECO-PROTECTORS
This project is an electronic set up which will give the data of presence of pollutants of all types in water reservoirs,which will indicate the need of  proper cleaning of reservoirs that is very helpful for proper maintaining of water reservoirs which results in reduction of water pollution,and a healthy ECOSYSTEM as well as richness in BIODIVERSITY.

Exaplanation of the project on the basis of these terms-
1.Main purpose
2.Utility
3.System designing


1.MAIN PURPOSE-
The main purpose of the system is the cleaning of water reservoirs,that is removal of garbage and chemicals from water reservoirs.
Dumping is the main process for waste management for working units,which results in the reduction of water quality of these reservoirs which is very harmful for our environment,because water bodies are the main source for sustainability of society.
Therefore it's time to time cleaning is very necessary as well as the knowledge of amount of pollutants present in that water bodies is also very necessary, basically thos device is for that purpose only.

2.UTILITY-
Use of this system is explained with these important points.
a)It will give data of presence of different types of pollutants present in water i.e solid waste in the bottom,garbage that floats on water,chemicals present in water, and cleaning process of these pollutants are different,therfore authority can easily take action according to the presence of material's amount.
b)There are many lakes , ponds and revers in India , which are not getting proper cleaning due to lack of attention or may be any reason but  they are very pollutated ,sewage plabts are there for cleaning but what about the water reservoirs existence ,enviornment and it's biodiversity.There are many villages in which people using directly the water ,which is very dangerous if water is polluted,but we can provide the solution for this problem too with our system.
 It will update the amount of pollutants in water reservoirs continuesly and we can connect the data system to the authorities ,so they can analyse the need of the cleaning and can make their system and workers to work on it timely.

3.SYSTEM DESIGNING-
In system designing ,we are designing the system in three parts,and fourth step is the use of IOT for its execution.
PART A-
We use ultrasonic sensor/IR sensor for detecting the presence of floating garbage on water surface.This ultrasonic sensor is also very useful for checking water level.
There is a led fitted in sensor which blinks on the detection of material and according to that data will update on the system.

 

PART B-
In this, according to the water level we can detect the presence of garbage collected in the bottom of reservoir, according to that it will update the amount of garbage on the system.

PART C-
For collecting the data of chemicals and industrial pollutants present in water, here we use capacitive sensors, and with the help of IOT ,it forwards the data to the system
 

IOT will play a major role here for the conversion of signals to data and for transferring the data to the system.
In this way system will help in making our environment pollution free.
